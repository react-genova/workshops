 SLIDE 01: All you need is L.O.V.S - List Of Valuable Suggestions
------------------------------------------------------------------
Developer tools (setting you up, boring part)
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/it/)
- Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
	- Babel ES6/ES7
	- ESLint
	- Flow Language Support
	- Path Intellisense
	- Relative Path

React (here is the big guy)
- create-react-app (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
- recompose (https://github.com/acdlite/recompose)
- styled-components (https://www.styled-components.com/)

Redux (Dan Abramov AKA gaeron AKA the genius)
- redux (https://redux.js.org/)
- react-redux (https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
- reselect (https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)
- redux-immutable (https://github.com/gajus/redux-immutable)

Testing (the better you test, the longer you rest)
- jest (https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- react-styleguidist (https://react-styleguidist.js.org/)
- enzyme (https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)

Libraries (and yes, there's no jQuery)
- axios (https://github.com/axios/axios)
- lodash (https://lodash.com/)
- immutable (https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)

In-depth technological study (not enough? some more stuff)
- project folder structure (really, are you serious?)
- middleware in redux (the redux source of power)
- Higher Order Components (how inheritance works in math)
- avoiding side effects (redux-saga, redux-effects, redux-cycles)
- npm and package.json (I am root)
- Functional Reactive Programming (FRP or F&RP, the long fight)

 SLIDE 02: Conclusions - Yeah, interesting, so in short?
--------------------------------------------------------- 
Just the first time
- Download and install Node.js
- Download and install Visual Studio Code and its plugins
- > npm install flow-bin flow-typed
Each time you create an app
- > npm install create-react-app
- > create-react-app your-app-pretty-cool-name
- > cd your-app-pretty-cool-name
- > npm install --save styled-components recompose react-redux flow-bin redux redux-immutable redux-logger reselect axios axios-mock-adapter immutable lodash enzyme jest-immutable-matchers jest-serializer-enzyme react-styleguidist react-test-renderer redux-test-utils
- Configure your 'package.json' file (https://github.com/react-genova/workshops/blob/master/01/resources/pacakge.json.addons)
- Add linter config file '.eslintrc' (https://github.com/react-genova/workshops/blob/master/01/resources/.eslintrc)
- Add flow config file '.flowconfig' (https://github.com/react-genova/workshops/blob/master/01/resources/.flowconfig)
- Add styleguidist config file 'styleguide.config.js' (https://github.com/react-genova/workshops/blob/master/01/resources/styleguide.config.js)
