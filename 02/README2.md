# Your First React App

This is a very simple client/server example.  
The client, a React Application, shows a list of movies and allows the user to rate a movie.  
The server, a Node.js server, exposes through rest api the list of movies and the possibility to change movies ratings.

## Server

### Documentation

The server main page describes how the server works and documents api rest in details.
We tested our server using [POSTman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and published the full API on POSTman server.
